### Nutrition information

Nutrition information is a highly controversial and regulated topic in Europe and in the US.

Dating back to 1979, EU regulation on food labelling was initially designed as a tool for the free circulation of food products and beverages in the European community ([Directive 79/112/EEC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31979L0112)).

Mandatory labelling in the US was introduced in the 1960's, with the rise of prepared meals, listing the ingredients. But it's only in 1990 the USDA passed the obligation of displaying *"consistent claims"* about **nutritious facts**.

Later, demand for further details emerged. Food labelling came at the intersection of two highly political topics :

1. health ;
2. public information.


---

### Standardisation of nutrition data (EU)

.pull-left[[Regulation EC 1169/11](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32011R1169) establishes the current legislation on food labelling. It's better known as **INCO**

INCO requires the vast majority of pre-packed food to provide information about energy value and amount of several nutritents (fat, saturates, carbohydrate, sugars, protein and salt) in *"legible, tabular format on the packaging"* or, if space doesn't allow, in linear format. Voluntary information can be added.
]

.pul-right[![](./img/food_label_eu_standard.jpg)

The information is required to be expressed per 100 grams or per 100 ml (per portion is optional).

Those information can be displayed on the back of the packaging of the food product or on the front. They usually are labelled on the first, hence called *"back-of-pack nutrition labelling"*]

### A step further : front-of-pack information

.pull-left[According to the action plan of the new *"Farm to fork strategy"*, the European Commission intends to submit a new regulation requiring **front-of-pack nutrition information** by the end of 2022.

The goals are numerous : promoting sustainable farming, restrict promotion of foods high in fats ... all falling under the umbrella of **Claims regulation**.]

### The Nutri-Score : origins


National programs on front-of-package food labelling already exist to guide consumer's choices toward healthier food products.

In 2014, Santé Publique France's Pr. Serge Hercberg and his team designed a indicator of the nutritional quality based on a letter graduation (from A to E) ranging the food products from the most to the least healthy : the [Nutri-Score](https://www.vie-publique.fr/rapport/33810-propositions-pour-un-nouvel-elan-de-la-politique-nutritionnelle).

.center[
![](./img/nutriscore_logos.png)
]

An arrêté of 2017 promotes its use. In March 2018, 52 brands commited to using them on their products.

---

### Calculation method 1 : scoring

The calculation metohd is based on **nutritent ratio for 100 g or ml**. Depending on the ratio for each nutrient, a number of points is attributed following a general rule : **the lower, the better**.

.pull-left[
.center["N" for "negative" nutrients :
![](./img/nutriscore_n_points.png)
]]

.pull-right[
.center["P" for "positive" nutrients :
![](./img/nutriscore_p_points.png)
]]

Many other specific cases apply. Notably for :

* **beverages** with a specific scoring scale and a dedicated grading system (see next slide);
* **infant food products** with a specific scoring system for added fats.


---

### Calculation method 2 : grading

The final score is compared to a scale depending on the nature of the food product : from A to E, with a minimum of -1 to 0 for A and a maximum for producted scoring over 19.

#### Other nutrition scores

.pull-left[
.center[#### The NP score
]

[The NP (for nutrient profiling) model](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nutrient-profiling-model) was developped by the UK Food Standard Administration in 2004-2005 to help the Office for Communication improve balance of television advertising for chilrend.

This administration having introduced in 2007 controls restricting advertising for foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) and promoting their alternatives, the NP model focused on the beneficial nutrients important for chilren's diet.

NP model was the main inspiration for Nutri-Score grade system.

.pull-right[
.center[#### The Nova score

![](./img/nova_grades.png)
]

Grounding in the research of the potential health impact of highly processed food ([notably for cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28322183/)), NOVA ranges in 4 groups, depending on the level of processing of their ingredients :

1. Unprocessed or minimally processed foods
2. Processed culinary ingredients
3. Processed foods
4. Ultra-processed food and drink products
]


---

### The Nutri-Score : rising

.pull-left[
In 2020, [a poll paid for by Santé Publique France](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/determinants-de-sante/nutrition-et-activite-physique/documents/enquetes-etudes/nutri-score-evolution-de-sa-notoriete-sa-perception-et-son-impact-sur-les-comportements-d-achat-declares-entre-2018-et-2020) noted the popularity of the Nutri-Score :

* 93% of the people surveyed knew of the Nutri-Score ;
* 90% identify it as a tool to assess nutritious facts about food products ;
* 18% spontaniously declare to use it for their food choices ;
* 89% consider Nutri-Score display on food products should be mandatory.]


.pull-right[
This popularity was syngergised by the release of a phone app allowing consumers to display a meta nutrition score (in which the Nutri-Score accounts for 60% of the grade) by scanning barcodes : **[Yuka](https://yuka.io/)**.

![](./img/yuka.png)
]

---

### The Nutri-Score : resistance

As its popularity grew, the Nutri-Score was adopted by more and more brands as well as other countries : Belgium, Germany and Spain. In 2019, [the proposal was made by scientists](https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2021/03/16/l-appel-de-270-scientifiques-pour-l-adoption-du-logo-nutri-score-en-europe_6073326_3244.html) to take it to the EU level.

And so began a food fight ...

Several methods were used by groups to block futher developpment of the Nutri-Score :

* **Nutri Score - the Phantom menace** : most of the big food companies simply refused to implement the Nutri-Score, denying information about highly consumed food products and beverages (among which : Ferrero, Kellogg’s, Mars, Mondelez, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Unilever, Kraft ...) ;
* **Nutri Score - The Empire strikes back** : Italian representation in the EU institutions formed a front against Nutri-Score, pushed by local government and food lobbies (escpecially [Parmigiano Regiano y Grand Padano PDO](https://www.parmigianoreggiano.com/news/parmigiano-reggiano-grana-padano-against-nutriscore/))
* **Nutri-Score - Attack of the clones** : Italy also fought back with the creation of an alternative indicator, the Nutrinform battery system (see bellow).

### The Nutri-Score : a new hope

### OpenFoodFacts : a common for food

.pull-left[
.center[
![](./img/openfoodfacts-logo-en.svg)
]

[Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/discover) is a collaborative database relying on citizen contribution to document food and beverages content.

Created in 2012 by the French developper and food blogger Stéphane Gigandet, it references over 660000 products in 150 countries compiled by to more than 15000 contributors.]

.pull-right[Thanks to food labelling regulation, contributors are able to document key nutritious facts about food products.

As those data are standardised by law (amount per 100 grams or 100 ml) products can be compared.

But, Open Food Facts (or OFF) also features all sort of criteria and labels, such as : allgergens, origin of the product ... and nutrition scores.]

### Can data science help us understand this debate ?


---

### This way for example ?

here are small multiple graphs documenting the distribution of the brands' products as documented by OpenFoodFacts regarding NOVA and/or Nutri-Score (barchart ? Scatter plot x=NOVA, y=Nutri ?) ;

---


### Here is what we did

1. reading / tidying / understanding OFF database => loading the data ;
2. groupby brands / select NOVA and Nutri variable / plot => analyzing the data ;
3. arranging it in a comprehensive way => understanding the data.

## So what is the program of this class again ?


---

### Here is the programm

- Day 1 : use Python, load OFF
- Day 2 : analysis and plots
- Day 3 : advanced analysis, functions ; recompute NOVA or NutriScore => alternate scores

### Evaluation
