## A .red[*"data state of mind"*]

.quote["you should be looking for data stored in computers. Usually that‚Äôs going to be data that you analyse in order to quantify or measure something or otherwise prove your point. [...] you‚Äôre not relying solely -- or even primarily -- on people to tell you what‚Äôs going on. Documents and data tend to have a better memory and be more honest."]

## Case study : going on holidays with data-oriented people

### Case #0 : the Bilbao situation

**Real world situation** : Sylvain was on a day-trip to Bilbao (Northern Spain / Southern Basque country) with family. His mum wanted to go to the Gunggenheim. His sister had to take a bus at the bus station at 3. Sylvain noted local coffee roaster he'd like to try. They all wanted to *"walk around"*.


.pull-left-narrow[

**Question** : which path should they choose to fulfill everyone's demand without compromising Sylvain's sister return to France ?

**Data state of mind approach** : Let's build a map based on the coordinates of the spots to see if a pattern emerges !

### Methods

The data state of mind grows on some practices and methods that developp a culture of data which enables it for day-to-day use.

Those methods include :

* **the "dream data base"** : imagine the data that would perfectly meet your need to assess a fact and try to close in on the closest existing data source ;

* **the funnel search** : start from the general data including the cases you're looking for and narrow down until you can't find anything more specific ;

* **the closest neighbour search** : dig into a database you already know and which is related to your topic of interest to find clues that lead you to data directly describing what you're looking for.

Extra skills :

* advanced Google search operators ;
* census and data collection regulations knowledge ;
* public statistics, etc.

## Case studies : data state of mind resolution of real world questions

---

### Case #1 : match-fixing in tennis

**Real world situation** : World tennis authorities have been handled evidence of match fixing by top players in international tournaments following a worldwide investigation. But none of the players identified as suspicious of rigging the results were sanctionned or banned from playing in competition.


.pull-left-narrow[

**Question** : how can you identify the players and matches that can be under some pressure or manipulation in favor of gambling organisations ?

.pull-right-wide[
**Data state of mind approach** : [Let's analyze tons of matches](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/heidiblake/the-tennis-racket) and find out the ones that play against the odds but in line with unusually big bets.

### Case #2 : swimming pool spotting

**Real world situation** : French tax legislator mandates home owner to report construction of some specific extensions of their property : garage, swimming pools and veranda. Swimming pools are taxed based on their surface.


.pull-left-narrow[

**Question** : how can we spot the undeclared swimming pools to confront home owners and claim those unpaid taxes ?

**Data state of mind approach** : Let's train an AI to spot the shape and color of swimming pools on satellite images (credit : [Generation NT](https://www.generation-nt.com/actualites/fisc-piscine-detection-ia-generalisation-ign-capgemini-google-dgfip-2004459)).
