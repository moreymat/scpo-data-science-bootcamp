### .red[Datactivist]: We .red[open data], we make them .red[useful]

<img style="float:right; margin:10px ; width:200px" src="https://datactivist.coop/recife/img/stickerdatapeople.png" />

- Datactivist is a French cooperative company specialized in open data, created in 2016.

- We work throughout the entire lifecycle of data with .red[**both data producers and reusers**] and participate in the appropriation of data by everyone.

- We practice what we preach and contribute to .red[**commons**] : we are a workers co-operative and our productions are freely usable by anyone.

- We believe .red[**research**] can help us better understand and solve the issues we face in the open data field.

### Why does .red[Datactivist] talk to you about data science ?

.pull-left[
**1. We are working with organizations you are likely to work for (or equiv.)**

**2. Our approach to digital transformation is (open) data centric and user centric**

### One (very) quick example of what we do


**Research and data mapping for the RATP** about all data sources available at regional level.

people working in a niche market - open data - datactivist has evolved with the demands of its customers by going up the whole data cycle (open data being the final step). We now help organizations to engage their digital transformation - big pictures - but at the center of our methods: the digital transformation by the data - and even the opening of the data 
And this is a trend that we see in the organizations you are likely to work for later on

### .red[For what purposes] will you practice data science in a public affairs curriculum ?


* **#1** Digital transformation of organizations is now based on (open) data

* **#2** Data are raw material to design and implement data-driven policies

* **#3** There is a very engaging legal and political framework
